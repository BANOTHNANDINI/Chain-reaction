                <ul>
                    <li>The game is played on a 6x6 grid.</li>
                    <li>Players take turns placing their colored balls in any cell.</li>
                    <li>Cells have limits: 1 ball in corners, 2 balls on edges, and 3 balls in the center.</li>
                    <li>When a cell exceeds its limit, it explodes, distributing balls to adjacent cells.</li>
                    <li>Exploding balls convert the color of any opposing balls in adjacent cells.</li>
                    <li>The game ends when one player controls all the balls on the board.</li>
                    <li>Player colors are assigned randomly at the start of each game.</li>
                    <li>The first move of each player cannot end the game.</li>
